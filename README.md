#                Equijob: Balancing Bias in Job Descriptions

Despite significant advancements in diversity and inclusion, employment discrimination remains a pervasive issue globally. According to a 2020 World Economic Forum report, gender parity alone is estimated not to be achieved for another 257 years. Unconscious bias often manifests in job descriptions, with a study from the University of Waterloo and Duke University revealing that gender-coded language can discourage certain applicants.

For instance, the use of words like ‘dominant’ or ‘competitive’ can dissuade female candidates, while ‘collaborative’ or ‘supportive’ may deter male applicants. Similarly, age bias, often subtle, can deter qualified candidates from applying.

‘EquiJob: Using AI to Balance Bias in Job Descriptions’ aims to address this issue by creating an AI tool that can detect and highlight potentially biased language in job descriptions, promoting more inclusive hiring practices.
